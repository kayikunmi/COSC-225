    <p>The self-similar image is created using SVG 
      The drawCircleWithDiamond function draws circles 
      and diamonds (two triangles) recursively. 
      Starting with a circle at the center, 
      it draws four diamonds at the corners of 
      the circle, and then recursively repeats this process 
      with a reduced radius and depth for each corner, 
      creating a self-similar pattern. The scale factor 
      determines the size of the circles and diamonds, and 
      the depth controls the level of recursion and 
      complexity of the image.</p>
