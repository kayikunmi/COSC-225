    <h3>The self-similar image is created using SVG 
      (Scalable Vector Graphics) and JavaScript. 
      The function drawCircleWithDiamond draws circles 
      and diamonds (triangles) recursively. 
      Starting with a circle at the center, 
      it draws four diamonds (triangles) at the corners of 
      the circle, and then recursively repeats this process 
      with reduced radius and depth for each corner, 
      creating a self-similar pattern. The scale factor 
      determines the size of the circles and diamonds, and 
      the depth controls the level of recursion and 
      complexity of the image. 
      The circles have no fill and a black stroke, 
      while the diamonds (triangles) have a green 
      fill and no stroke. The resulting image is a visually 
      interesting and intricate pattern formed by the circles 
      and diamonds. Overall, this code uses SVG and JavaScript to 
      generate a self-similar image with geometric shapes. 
      Be sure to have an SVG element with an id of "main-svg" 
      in your HTML file to render the image. You can also adjust 
      the initial parameters of the function call to drawCircleWithDiamond 
      to modify the appearance of the image.</h3>
